Multi-Page Website Project

This is one of my early web development projects where I created a **multi-page website** using only HTML.  
The project demonstrates structuring pages, navigation, and deploying a site on Netlify.  

---

## Features
- Multi-page navigation (Home, About, Contact, etc.)
- Clean and semantic HTML structure
- Organized content without CSS or frameworks
- Deployed on **Netlify** for live demo

---

## What I Learned
- Creating and linking multiple web pages
- Using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Setting up project structure with `index.html` and subpages
- Deploying static websites on Netlify
